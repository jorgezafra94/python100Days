You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
